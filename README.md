This is a kernel that I compiled for the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 (N910C) variant. This is my first ever release so please tell me what I did wrong and what can be improved :D

Introducing OPT1M1S3-N4 kernel for the Samsung Galaxy Note 4.

There are 5 vareints (for now*) to choose from, from no undervolt to undervolt.
