Introducing OPT1M1S3-N4 kernel for the Samsung Galaxy Note 4.

This is a kernel that I compiled for the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 (N910C) variant. This is my first ever release so please tell me what I did wrong and what can be improved :D

There are 5 vareints (for now*) to choose from, from no undervolt to undervolt.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Your warrenty is now void.

// I am not responsible for anything that may happen such bricked devices, dead SD Cards and etc.

// Please do some research first and whatnot.

// YOU are choosing to make these modifications to your phone.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anyways, lets get to the installation :D

1) Download the kernel of any variant you would like to use.
2) Reboot to TWRP.
3) Flash the .img file to boot.
4) Restart your device and enjoy! :D
